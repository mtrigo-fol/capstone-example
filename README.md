# User Roles (Optional)

If (and only if) you app has more than one *user role*. 

A user role is indicated by a _distinct way of using the app_. If a user uses completely different activities, or uses activities in a completely different way (and for a different reason) than your "regular user", then that's a second user role.

In other words, if you need to QA features "as a certain type of user", then it's a distinct user role.
